About Biesse-postprocessor

This postprocessor is written on node.js. Its purpose is to create control programs for woodworking equipment of "Biesse Group". The postprocessor receives the original data from dxf-files exported by the program "3d-constructor". Also, postprocessor functionality includes parsing the export file from the "2d-place" program and creating an import file with a project detail for the "Holzma" sawing center.
